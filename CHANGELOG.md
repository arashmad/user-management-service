# User Management Service

<!-- This page lists all releases/release notes for React Router back to `v6.0.0`. For releases prior to v6, please refer to the
[Github Releases Page](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases).

We manage release notes in this file instead of the paginated Github Releases Page for 2 reasons:

-   Pagination in the Github UI means that you cannot easily search release notes for a large span of releases at once
-   The paginated Github interface also cuts off longer releases notes without indication in list view, and you need to click into the detail view to
    see the full set of release notes -->

This is the first version of the a Node/Express Web API application, in which basic configurations e.g. test, build and run commands were set.
